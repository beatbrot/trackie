# Contributing to this repository 

Before you begin:

- This repository contains a rust project. You can get the latest version of the rust compiler & toolchain from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- As editor, we use IntelliJ IDEA Community with the [Rust Plugin](https://intellij-rust.github.io/). If you own IDEA Ultimate or CLion, feel free to use that instead.
  - You can of course use any editor you prefer, as long as your code is formatted with rustfmt and does not introduce new rustc or clippy warnings.
- The aim of this project is to provide a simple time tracker. We do not add features that make the UX more complicated without good reason. If you plan to make larger changes, consider describingt them in an issue first so that we can discuss.
